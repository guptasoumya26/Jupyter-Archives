    "A decision tree is a graph that uses a branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision. Lets start by taking a example of OR of two variables X1 and X2. The decison tree for the same is shown below :\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"OR_DT.png\">\n",
    "We have total four possible combinations as shown in the truth table. So at the beginning we have 2 True and 2 False outcomes to start with. The first condition we check for is the value of X1. If X1 is true then we are sure that the result will be true and hence we arrive at 2 true and no false. Note that ,we only consider those rows of the table which are having X1 as true i.e. the first and the third row in the current example .That is why we have 2 total outcomes out of which 2 are true and none is false. This node is having a definite answer.If we arrive at this node there is no confusion as to which what our tree should return, therefore these are called <b>pure nodes</b>.<br>\n",
    "If X1 is false then the answer is dependant on the value of X2. If X2 is false the answer is false and if the answer is true the final result is true. We have three pure nodes here as shown in the pictorial representation of the decision tree.\n",
    "Now if we are given any new data for prediction we just need to run it through our tree. For example if we get A and B as two values for testing. We check first if A is true. If A is true we have true as our answer else we need to check for the value of B. If B is true then our answer agin is true else we have false as the final outcome.\n",
    "Lets consider another example which is not as straight forward as the previous one. Suppose we need to predict that if a person will get interview call or not based on some factors. There can be many factors but for simplicity lets consider that we focus on the level of projects, good inten and whether the person is from top 50 colleges or not.<br>\n",
    "Unlike the previous example in which we just picked X1 for the first decision, it is quite arguable that which factor should we pick first here. Lets assume that we start by picking whether the person has done a good internship or not(which is in the form of true or false).\n",
    "<img src=\"DT_interview.png\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Similarly we continue to break down the nodes further on the basis of the features which are still left(type of college and projects in this case ).<br/>\n",
    "Consider a case where we have used up all the features and still we do not arrive at a pure node. Cases like this can surely be true. For eg: we may have three students lacking in all the three fields but still one gets the interview call and the other two do not. In such a case, our node which corresponds to \"no\" at each of the above three decisions cannot give a pure no as answer i.e. it is not a pure node. What should we do then? As we do not have anymore features left to judge on, we can simply favour the majority class of the node.<br>\n",
    "Therefore, there are two cases when we need to stop with the breaking of nodes into subparts, those are :<br>\n",
    "1) When we have a pure node, there is no need to proceed further.<br>\n",
    "2) When all the features are used and we dont have any other feature present.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Depending upon which factor we pick to split on we can have different Decision trees and their accuracy will also vary. We will discuss how to pick a decent tree in the next section. What we should note is that till now we have only considered the examples where we have binary( true or false ) as outcomes. If a partucular feature has n different values, we may have to break a node into n subnodes. If a feature has all unique entry then we reach the pure nodes in one step but for many cases that is useless. For example, dividing a class of students on the basis of their roll number into subnodes may result in all pure nodes but it is of no use."

Then we will be having n candidate splits at the first level. Now, we will calculate how much accuracy each split will cost us, using a function. The split(feature) which results in maximum accuracy is choosen at this level and data points are divided into child nodes according to that feature only. The child nodes formed are recursively divided into deeper levels, resulting in formation of the entire tree.\n",

For finding out the best tree all possible combinations of tree possible should be taken care off. So, we are interested here to find out the good tree and not the best one. Using the GREEDY approach, we will try to lower the cost (and also maximize the accuracy) and according to this, build a good decision tree."

Right node similarly reprents students who are not great interns, total of 42 students, and again out of which 5 got a call for interview and 37 didn't. So, we take our decision as YES for left side child node and NO for side side child node (according to majority only).
